CPU Scheduling SimulatorOverviewThis project is a CPU Scheduling Simulator that visualizes the execution of processes under different scheduling algorithms. It includes a frontend (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for user interaction and a backend (Python with Flask) to handle the scheduling logic.FeaturesMultiple Scheduling Algorithms:First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)Shortest Job First (SJF)Priority SchedulingRound Robin (RR)User-Friendly Interface: A web-based interface allows users to input process details (arrival time, burst time, priority) and select a scheduling algorithm.Gantt Chart Visualization: Displays a Gantt chart to illustrate the process execution timeline.Performance Metrics: Calculates and displays average turnaround time and average waiting time.PrerequisitesBefore running the simulator, ensure you have the following installed:Python: Download and install from python.org.Flask: Install via pip:pip install Flask
InstallationClone the repository:git clone <your_repository_url>
cd cpu-scheduling-simulator
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:On Windows: venv\Scripts\activateOn macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activateInstall Flask (if not installed globally):pip install Flask
UsageStart the Flask backend:python app.py
The server will start running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.Open the frontend:Open index.html in your web browser.  If you are using VS Code, you can use the Live Server extension, or simply double-click the file in your file explorer.Interact with the simulator:Select a scheduling algorithm from the dropdown menu.Enter the number of processes.Provide the arrival time, burst time, and (if applicable) priority for each process.Click the "Calculate" button to simulate the scheduling process.View the results, including the Gantt chart and performance metrics.
